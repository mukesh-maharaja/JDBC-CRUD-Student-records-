# JDBC CRUD - Student Records Management System üéìüìã

A Java-based Student Records Management System that utilizes **JDBC** for database interaction. This project allows users to perform **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a database table that stores student information.

---

## Features ‚ú®

1. **Create**:  
   - Add new student records to the database.
   
2. **Read**:  
   - View all student records or search for specific students by ID or name.

3. **Update**:  
   - Modify existing student records, such as updating names, grades, or contact details.

4. **Delete**:  
   - Remove student records from the database.

5. **Database Connectivity**:  
   - Utilizes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to a MySQL (or other relational) database.

6. **Error Handling**:  
   - Handles database connection issues, invalid inputs, and SQL exceptions gracefully.

## How to Use üïπÔ∏è

### 1. Set Up the Database
- Create a database (e.g., `student_db`) in your SQL server.
- Use the following SQL script to create the `students` table:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE student_db;

  USE student_db;

  CREATE TABLE students (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      age INT NOT NULL,
      grade VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
      email VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```

### 2. Configure Database Connection
- Update the database connection parameters in the Java code (e.g., `DB_URL`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`):
  ```java
  private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student_db";
  private static final String DB_USER = "root";
  private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "password";
  ```

### 3. Run the Application
- Compile the code:
  ```bash
  javac StudentCRUDApp.java
  ```
- Run the application:
  ```bash
  java StudentCRUDApp
  ```

## Functionalities üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Add Student Record
- Enter student details such as name, age, grade, and email.
- The record will be inserted into the database.

### 2. View All Students
- Displays all student records from the database in a tabular format.

### 3. Search Student
- Search for a specific student by their ID or name.

### 4. Update Student Record
- Modify existing student information using the student ID as a reference.

### 5. Delete Student Record
- Remove a student record from the database using their ID.
